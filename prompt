  I'm a brand manager at Plantae, a Thai brand and products are available in Thailand only. I am
  developing a marketing campaign to drive the adoption of Plantae's new ready-to-drink
  plant-based protein product in convenience stores. For now, I'm struggling to write a good
  KOL brief for presenting the product. I need your help in doing this.
